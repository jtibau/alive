ALIVE
Abstract Layer for Immersive Virtual Environments

INTRODUCTION

ALIVE is both an abstract library and a collection of backends,
to be used in immersive virtual environments. It is currently
being developed as part of my M.Sc. in Computer Graphics from
Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Foremost, it is meant as an abstraction from some of the core
technologies involved in creating clustered graphics applications.
It allows the user to write only rendering specific code, and
wraps itself around such code.

REQUIREMENTS

ALIVE is provided as a collection of header files. However,
in order to make use of it, a backend must be configured to do
the actual rendering.

At the present time, the only available backend works against
the VR Juggler Framework. You should be able to install the
latest version (3.0 beta, or svn preferably).

If you want to compile and run the polygon renderer that implements
ALIVE, you also need the latest version of OpenSceneGraph.
