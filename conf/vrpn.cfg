# Fastrak Tracker. Runs a Polhemus Fastrak tracker that is attached to a serial
# port on this machine. This driver will also run an InterSense IS600 or IS900
# tracker, but you will want to include extra initialization code (as described
# below) to set up the ultrasonic pip information, wand devices, stylus devices
# and so forth. Arguments that go on the first line:
#	char	name_of_this_device[]
#	char	name_of_serial_device[]
#	int	baud_rate_of_serial_device
#
# It is possible to add additional commands that will be sent to the tracker
# by putting the backslash character (\) at the end of the config line. This
# will cause the following line to be read in and sent to the Fastrak during
# the reset routine. You can add additional lines by putting a slash at the
# end of each command line but the last. Each line will be sent to the Fastrak
# with a newline at the end of it. If a line starts with an asterisk (*), then
# it is treated as a line telling how long to sleep, with the integer number of
# seconds following the *.
#
# Commands to add Joysticks (2 buttons) or Wands (5 buttons and 2 analogs) to
# the various sensors on the Isense900 are done by adding Stylus and
# Wand command lines before the reset command lines.  Each of these lines
# takes two arguments: the name of the button (for Stylus) or button and
# analog (for Wand) servers, and the sensor number (starting from 0).  The
# Wand line takes eight additional parameters, which specify the scaling
# and clipping behavior of the two directions on the analog joystick.  Each
# set of for is the min, lowzero, hizero, and max values: these are mapped
# to -1, 0,0, and 1 (all values between lowzero and hizero are mapped to 0).
# Start with these at -1,0,0,1 and use the 'printcereal' program or some other
# method to read them and see what the range of acheivable values is.  Then,
# set them to slightly conservative values so that the whole range is covered
# and the analogs will report zero when the joystick is centered. The
# presence of these lines is indicated by placing them after any additional
# reset command lines, by ending the line preceding them with the front slash
# "/" character.
#
# Note that this frontslash and backslash-notation can only be used for the
# Fastrak/Isense tracker, not to extend the line for any other type of device
# listed in this configuration file.

# 3Space Tracker. Runs a Polhemus 3Space (not Fastrak) tracker that is attached
# to a serial port on this machine. Note that as of VRPN 04.07 there is some sort
# of bug in the 3Space orientation decoding; nobody has had enough need for this
# to fix it yet. Arguments:
#	char	name_of_this_device[]
#	char	name_of_serial_device[]
#	int	baud_rate_of_serial_device

# Wands button/analog, driver from Brown University. Runs a Wanda device
# attached to a serial port.  As of Aug 28, 2000 this driver was untested on
# Windows machines.  The code compiles fine for them, so it seems like things
# should work okay...
